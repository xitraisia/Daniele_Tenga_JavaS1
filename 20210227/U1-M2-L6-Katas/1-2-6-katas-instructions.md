# 1.2.6 Katas

## Katas

## Introduction

In this kata, you will practice creating a class, with objects, states, and behaviors. You will think like a programmer by diagramming the hierarchical logic behind your class and building it from the inside out.

## Requirements for All Katas

- Create an IntelliJ project called `U1M2L6Katas`.

- All classes should be part of the `com.company` package.

- All classes should have a `no-args` (or the `default`) constructor.

## Kata 1: Building a Home

In this activity, you will create a class that represents a home. Your class should be composed of objects that represent the rooms listed. Each object should have states and behaviors appropriate to it, like the following examples:

- Square footage

- Room length

- Room width

- Flooring type

- Ceiling height

- Any additional states and behaviors relevant to a room

Use the following rooms/objects as a starting point, and add any additional rooms as needed:

- Bedroom

- Kitchen

- Bathroom

- Basement

- Patio

**Hint:** Start with the innermost, or smallest, component parts and build up from there to model the object as a whole.

**Hint:** Start by creating a UML diagram of the class. Then use that as your guide and write the code for the class.
